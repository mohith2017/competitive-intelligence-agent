@2606_Tavily_FDE_TakeHomeAssignment.md (1-66) 

I'm guessing I have to choose one of the directions from the above example directions for the sake of this exercise, which might prove high value based on this role that I'm interviewing for - 
https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/tavily/1999e01d-f9e3-4f43-a097-812c0800fb0f 

And the sample agent @2606_Tavily_FDE_TakeHome/starter_agent.py 

Let's work on a plan for this and give me a plan that I can review and talk through

---

**Cursor**

I'll research the materials before proposing a plan. Let me look at the starter agent, the existing project folder, and the job posting in parallel.

There's already a `competitive-intel-agent` project scaffolded. Let me explore what's actually there (excluding the virtualenv) and get the job details.

A prior session already started a "competitive-intel-agent" scaffold (logfire installed, a sample brief output format, package skeleton). Let me check the examples folder and whether there's a pyproject, plus prior chat context.

The prior scaffold is mostly aspirational (a sample output, logfire installed, package skeleton) with no agent code or `pyproject.toml` yet. Let me quickly confirm the FDE role's focus and peek at any prior session reasoning so my plan is well-grounded.

I've got what I need to shape a strong plan. Before I write it up, two decisions genuinely change the shape of the work, so let me confirm them with you.

Quick context on what I found:
- The take-home is Option 1 (improve `starter_agent.py`), and the role is a customer-facing **Forward Deployed Engineer** who builds RAG pipelines, agent workflows, **evaluation loops**, and reference architectures on Tavily's API — with explicit value on **trustworthy sourcing** and bonus points for **tracing/observability**.
- There's already a partial scaffold in `competitive-intel-agent/` (a package skeleton, an `.env` with `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`, `logfire` installed, and a `sample_brief.md` showing a "source-verified competitive intelligence brief" output format) — but no real agent code or `pyproject.toml` yet.

**Scope the Tavily take-home plan**

> **Which use-case direction should the improved agent target? The existing scaffold points at a source-verified competitive intelligence brief generator, which maps cleanly to the FDE role (industry-specific GenAI use case + citations + evals + observability).**
> - Continue the Competitive Intelligence brief agent that's already scaffolded (Recommended)
> - General deep-research assistant with citations (broader, less customer-specific)
> - A different specific customer workflow (I'll describe it)
>
> Answer: Use the basic competitive intelligence agent I've copied as a template/skeleton from github. But generate an entirely new plan for this.

> **How much should I build in the ~4-6 hour budget? This sets how much goes into UX vs. evals vs. observability.**
> - Core agent + citations + a small eval loop + Logfire tracing, CLI only (Recommended) ✔
> - Just a polished core agent + citations + tracing (skip the eval loop)
> - Core agent + a minimal web UI demo (more visual, less depth on evals)

Good — continue with the competitive intelligence direction using the copied skeleton, scope to core agent + citations + eval loop + Logfire tracing (CLI only), and I'll design a fresh plan. Let me confirm what dependencies the skeleton already pins so the plan builds on what's there.

I have everything I need. Here's what I found about the skeleton so the plan builds on it precisely:

- The copied skeleton is minimal: `src/competitive_intel/__init__.py`, an `.env` template (with `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`), `examples/sample_brief.md` (the target output format), empty `tests/`, and a `uv.lock` — but no `pyproject.toml` and no agent code yet.
- The lockfile already pins a deliberate, modern stack: `langchain 1.x`, `langchain-openai`, `langchain-anthropic`, `langchain-tavily`, `logfire[httpx]`, and `openinference-instrumentation-langchain` (OpenTelemetry-based tracing — directly relevant to the bonus points). Note it dropped `langchain-nebius`, so Nebius will be reached via the OpenAI-compatible `ChatOpenAI`.

Now I'll write up the plan for you to review and talk through.

**User**

@2606_Tavily_FDE_TakeHomeAssignment.md (1-66) 
Ok, so here's what I'd share in terms of what I'm thiinking for the project - 
Firstly, in detail explain every module in TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md and docs/ (not the root README). Include a requirements mapping table: each assignment example direction → specific module(s) → how it creates business/technical value.

1. I think the project should be as comprehensive enough to explain the project to a customer - so if we're choosing this competitive intel task, let's target people/industries who might need company resarch, like maybe Finance. Make sure that target audience is noted - add to business perspective explanation that's in the technical statement. Note also all the directions it solves with the help of a proper workflow diagram - part of the technical readme, remember the root readme needs to be skimmed and there should be docs folder that has runbooks for any of the run processes

Target audience: finance / investment research / corp dev teams doing pre-meeting or pre-deal company diligence. State this explicitly in TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md.

2. Develop an explainer that demonstrates an interesting technical concept related to AI engineering. This is your opportunity to showcase clear documentation, communication skills, and creativity. Diagrams and interactivity is highly encouraged.
For this requirement, I want you to enhance the plan to clearly showcase the documentation, repo structure, functionality, code blocks that are relevant, technical details, business context relevance at each step of the technical implementation and finally, based on the plan - change these parts to add this explainer

Enhance the plan to add docs/explainer/ as the Option 2 deliverable (publishable, diagram-heavy). Each page uses a dual-audience template: a short Business takeaway box + a Technical depth section with real code references from src/competitive_intel/.



3. Let's keep the concept related to the RAG part of the agent comprehensive, clear and concise using the Tavily API as is, and make sure that the in-context retrieval has a self-correction loop, good practices around re-ranking the chunks. And there should be usage of the Claude API here , failing which an OpenAi api KEY can be used. In order to get info about the company. 
Use @Langchain docs to help enhance your plan on the RAG portion of the plan. Go deeper into this part to demonstrate best use of Tavily API using RAG, but don't make it too technically complex that the customer is not able to understand it (developer should see technical depth, but business user should see the value of Tavily) - the idea is to showcase this unique approach for handling this deep research task over here.

Frame as LangChain Hybrid RAG (retrieval docs): query enhancement → retrieve → validate → synthesize → verify. Synthesis is a 2-step grounded call via with_structured_output(Brief, method="function_calling", include_raw=True) — not a ReAct loop.

Primary: Claude (langchain-anthropic, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY). Fallback: OpenAI (langchain-openai, OPENAI_API_KEY). Factory in config.py.

Follow Tavily research best practices: specific company, focus areas, recency window, citations required. Use search_depth="advanced", time_range, topic, TavilySearch + TavilyExtract.


4. Let's focus deeply on 2 areas - The RAG Agent and the observability as there are the main areas which demonstrate huge business value of using Tavily along with the observability that is a good demo for both technical and business customers. 

5. For observability, make sure you Pydantic @Pydantic so that Pydantic-typed pipeline artifacts logged to Logfire spans. These are to share every step of the retrieval process , from evidence ledger build (dedupe, stable [S1..Sn] IDs, compact passages) → re-rank → synthesize → verify

Logfire: logfire.configure() + openinference-instrumentation-langchain + logfire.instrument_httpx() for Tavily HTTP. Log Pydantic models (RunSummary, RetrievalSpanMeta) via logfire.info(..., **model.model_dump()) and manual logfire.span() per pipeline stage. Do not add LangSmith as a second backend.

Now for what needs to change in the plan itself / enhanced - 
1. I like the React Tool loop but maybe we could try a hierarchical subagent structure with plan and execute to improve precision of the tasks and properly keep tasks separate from each other. Have tools separate for tavily, as well as for the RAG pipeline that can be aggregated after.

Tavily tools live in tools/tavily_tools.py; RAG orchestration in pipeline/; aggregation in synthesize.py + verify.py. Document this as context isolation in the explainer — same idea as subagents, simpler to verify. 

2. Let's change the architecture diagram based on this new changes based workflow

3. Make sure to ensure the langchain based code is verified with the latest documentation through the connected docs-langchain MCP server, add this to plan.  Make sure to use the indexed @Pydantic-docs for latest pydantic documentation and code. I've also indexed the tavily @Tavily and Pydantic Logfire @Pydantic-logfire

Before implementing each module, query docs-langchain MCP for the exact API (structured output, Tavily tools, middleware if used). Cross-check Pydantic v2 patterns and Logfire LangChain integration against indexed docs. Do not use APIs from memory without verification.

4. Did you properly use the structure of the https://github.com/vstorm-co/full-stack-ai-agent-template properly for the directory structure of the various documents within the codebase?

5. The deliverables are missing the Explainer, make sure you plan in detail for the various deliverables for the plan - @2606_Tavily_FDE_TakeHomeAssignment.md (55-56) Remember it needs to show equal business and technical focus so both audiences can consume, maybe even create a template here so that while building there are no issues.

Add explicit checklist:

Deliverable	File
Implementation repo (no starter_agent.py)
src/
Technical statement
TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md
Explainer (Option 2 topic)
docs/explainer/README.md + chapters
Build record
docs/BUILD_LOG.md or exported chat link
Sample output
examples/sample_brief.md
Explainer page template (per chapter):

## Business takeaway
[2–3 sentences for finance/corp dev reader]
## What problem this solves
[Starter limitation → our approach]
## How it works (technical)
[Diagram + link to src module]
## Code anchor
[Real function/class from repo — not pseudocode unless labeled]
## Tavily value
[Why this step needs live web data]

6. For the CLI tool let's use @Click-cli-docs for the cli based tooling. For any documentation indexes adn other changes, make sure the plan includes these in detail so you use them while building.
Use Click command group: competitive-intel brief ... (primary). Prefer options over positional args per Click design guidance. Entry point in pyproject.toml. Update deps: add click, remove typer if present.




7. Let's keep tests simple and only tailored to 2 use cases - 1 - RAG Agent and 2- Evals + Observability. No DeepEval, only deterministic eval

8. When the coding agent gets stuck -

## One architectural decision to lock before building

Your plan has synthesis as `with_structured_output` in a plain chain — **that is the right call** for this use case. LangChain's `create_agent` + `ToolStrategy` is better when the model needs to call tools *and* return structured output in one loop. Here retrieval is deterministic and synthesis is a single grounded call, which matches the [2-step RAG chain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/rag) pattern exactly.

Use `create_agent` only if you later add an optional "research mode" where the model decides when to search. For the take-home, stay with the pipeline.

---

9. For Eval, let's stick to deterministic metrics for now since we're mostly focussing on the RAG agent and the observability using Logfire for this project. And remove any references to the Nebius even when referencing the @2606_Tavily_FDE_TakeHome/starter_agent.py as the starting point for the agent.



10. I want you to maybe add a twist to the deep research task, where it uses an MCP server with tavily's results in order to have a hybrid RAG and tavily+MCP servers useful for this competitive intel

Runtime (default): langchain-tavily (TavilySearch + TavilyExtract). Explainer + integration story: Tavily MCP server (https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=...) for agent platforms (OpenAI Agent Builder, Claude desktop, etc.). Optional stretch: --via-mcp flag — only after core CLI + Logfire trace verified.

Assume whatever API keys are required I will add to the .env, so just change the .env.template


A. Build protocol (AI-assisted — addresses assignment line 64)
## Verification gates (human must confirm before "done")
- [ ] `uv run competitive-intel brief "Perplexity" --focus funding,product --window month` produces brief with resolvable [S#] citations
- [ ] Logfire trace shows plan → retrieve → rerank → synthesize → verify spans
- [ ] Explainer code blocks match actual `src/` module names
- [ ] `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`: 3+ decisions YOU made after agent output (what you rejected and why)
- [ ] No unverified generic RAG essay — every explainer section ties to this repo
B. Assignment requirements mapping (for TECHNICAL_STATEMENT)
| Assignment direction | Implementation |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Customer workflow | Finance competitive intel brief CLI |
| Integration | Tavily Search/Extract + Logfire; MCP documented |
| Retrieval quality | Advanced search, extract, rerank, 1 retry |
| Citations | Evidence ledger + deterministic verify |
| Context engineering | Planned queries, ledger, compact context |
| Observability | Logfire OTel per stage |
| Eval loop | Deterministic verify metrics only (not full framework) |
C. Anti-slop rules
No claiming “evaluation framework” — cite verification metrics only
No Pydantic AI / pydantic-evals unless you actually add them (you didn’t plan to)
LangChain APIs verified via MCP before each module
README < 2 min skim; depth lives in docs/
D. Demo script (for FDE live demo — 5 min)
Starter problem: one vague search, no citations, no trace
Run CLI for a real company
Walk brief: categories, citations, coverage %
Open Logfire: show Tavily HTTP + verify stage attributes
One sentence: “Reference architecture for finance diligence on Tavily”
E. Phased implementation order

Phase 1: models → retrieval → verify → synthesize → render → cli (smoke test)
Phase 2: observability → rerank → self-correction retry
Phase 3: docs/explainer → TECHNICAL_STATEMENT → BUILD_LOG → tests
Phase 4 (stretch): MCP doc polish, --via-mcp

Here's what I'd like to build in the RAG part that is different - 
## Unique context engineering: Evidence fusion (deep research)

Deep research fails when models see either (a) stale training data or (b) unranked search snippets.

Our approach — **Tavily Evidence Fusion**:
1. **Live layer:** TavilySearch (advanced, time_range) + TavilyExtract
2. **Lexical layer:** BM25Okapi over extracted passages, scored per category query
3. **Fusion:** Combine Tavily relevance score + BM25 (weighted or RRF); keep top-K
4. **Context layer:** Build contextual evidence ledger — stable [S#], category, as-of date, source title, compact passage (token-capped)
5. **Validation:** If top-K fused score below threshold → refine query, retrieve once more (max 1 retry)
6. **Synthesis:** Single `with_structured_output(Brief)` call — model sees ledger only, must cite [S#]

Explainer topic (Option 2): "Context engineering for deep research via Tavily Evidence Fusion"
- Business: finance diligence needs recency + precision + citations
- Technical: diagram of three layers; code anchors in retrieval.py, rerank.py, ledger.py
- Contrast starter: one untuned search vs fused, ledgered, verified pipeline

Modify the plan based on the abvoe

**Cursor**

This is a substantial revision. Let me verify a few things the user explicitly asked about — the reference template's structure and the LangChain MCP docs server — before rewriting the plan.

GitHub's API is flaky from here; the vstorm template is a full-stack FastAPI+Next.js app anyway, so I'll adapt its conventions to a CLI layout. Let me verify the key LangChain APIs via the connected docs MCP, since the plan should reference verified APIs.

I've verified the key LangChain APIs (Hybrid RAG pattern, `ToolStrategy`/`ProviderStrategy`, `with_structured_output(..., method=, include_raw=True)`, Tavily Search/Extract with `topic="finance"`). Now let me read the current plan file so I can rewrite it in place.

I have verified the critical APIs and have everything needed. Now I'll rewrite the plan in place to incorporate all your enhancements.

I've rewritten the plan in place at `competitive_intel_agent_c77d064b.plan.md`. Here's what changed and why.

**Core reframing**
- The agent is now explicitly a **finance / investment-research / corp-dev** diligence tool, stated as the target audience in `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md`, with a requirements-mapping table (each assignment direction → module → value).
- The RAG approach is now **Tavily Evidence Fusion** — a LangChain **Hybrid RAG** flow (query enhancement → retrieve → BM25+Tavily RRF rerank → typed evidence ledger with stable `[S#]` → self-correction retry → grounded synthesis → deterministic verify). I verified the Hybrid RAG and 2-step RAG patterns against the connected **docs-langchain MCP** and locked synthesis to `with_structured_output(Brief, method="function_calling", include_raw=True)` rather than a ReAct loop.
- The "subagent/plan-and-execute" idea is realized as **module-level context isolation** (`tools/tavily_tools.py` separate from `pipeline/`), documented as such in the explainer — deterministic and verifiable, with `create_agent` reserved for an optional future research mode.

**Two deep-focus areas**
- **RAG agent**: dedicated `pipeline/` package (plan, retrieve, rerank, ledger, orchestrator) + `synthesize.py`/`verify.py` aggregation. Adds `rank-bm25`.
- **Observability**: `logfire.configure()` + `openinference-instrumentation-langchain` + `logfire.instrument_httpx()`, per-stage `logfire.span()`, and Pydantic artifacts (`RunSummary`, `RetrievalSpanMeta`) logged via `model_dump()`. No LangSmith.

**Other changes you asked for**
- **Provider**: Claude primary (`langchain-anthropic`), OpenAI fallback; **all Nebius references removed**.
- **CLI**: switched to **Click** command group (`competitive-intel brief …`), options over positional args, entry point in `pyproject.toml`; `typer` removed.
- **Deliverables**: added the **Option 2 explainer** (`docs/explainer/`, dual-audience chapter template), `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md`, `docs/` with runbooks + architecture, `BUILD_LOG.md`, and a skimmable root README; full deliverables checklist included.
- **Tests**: only two deterministic suites (RAG agent; evals+observability), no DeepEval.
- **MCP twist**: runtime uses `langchain-tavily`; Tavily MCP server is the integration story + an optional `--via-mcp` stretch.
- **Build protocol**: doc-reference table, verification gates, anti-slop rules, demo script, phased order, and "verify APIs via MCP before each module."
- **New architecture diagram** reflecting the fusion + self-correction + observability flow.

**Two honest notes**
- GitHub's API was flaky from here, so I couldn't pull the exact `vstorm-co/full-stack-ai-agent-template` tree. It's a FastAPI+Next.js full-stack template, so I adapted its conventions (src-layout, isolated `tools/`, first-class `docs/`) to a CLI rather than copying it verbatim. If you want, I can fetch its exact tree later and reconcile.
- The plan keeps `.env.template` (not `.env`) updated with `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` for you to fill in.

Want me to refine anything further, or switch to agent mode and start Phase 1 (models → config → Tavily tools → pipeline → synthesize/verify/render → CLI smoke test)?

Competitive Intelligence Agent (Tavily FDE Take-Home)

Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

---

**Cursor**

I'll start implementing Phase 1. Let me mark the first todo in progress and inspect the current project state.

The todo list still shows the original todos. Let me replace them with the plan's actual todos.

Now let me create the project files. Starting with `pyproject.toml`, `.env.template`, and `.gitignore`.

Now let me verify the environment syncs. Running `uv sync`.

The shell is at the workspace root, not the subfolder. Let me cd explicitly.

There's a working `.venv` with `python`/`pip` (uv isn't installed). I'll use the venv's pip. Let me check what's already installed and add the new deps.

Missing only `click`, `rank-bm25`, and `pydantic-settings`. Let me install them.

The shell is already in the subfolder now (cwd persists). Installing directly.

All dependencies are in place. Marking setup done and moving to `models.py`.

`config.py` with settings and the Claude→OpenAI model factory.

Let me verify the Tavily tool API via the docs MCP before writing the tools module.

The docs MCP blocked broad listing; I already confirmed the Tavily integration surface earlier (`TavilySearch`/`TavilyExtract` with `search_depth`, `time_range`, `topic`, `include_raw_content`). I'll proceed with `langchain-tavily`. Updating todos and writing the tools.

Let me confirm the installed `langchain_tavily` API surface so my wrappers match exactly.

Confirmed the API. Writing `tools/tavily_tools.py`.

Now the pipeline package — `plan.py` and `retrieve.py`.

Now `rerank.py` (BM25 + Tavily RRF) and `ledger.py` (evidence ledger with stable `[S#]`).

`synthesize.py` — the grounded structured-output call.

`verify.py` — deterministic citation resolution, coverage, and recency.

`render.py` — Brief to markdown matching the sample format.

`observability.py` — Logfire + OpenInference + httpx, with graceful degradation.

`orchestrator.py` — the Hybrid RAG flow tying stages together with tracing.

Pipeline modules are done. Let me update the todos and write the CLI plus package exports.

Let me run an import smoke test across all modules to catch errors early.

The editable install record is stale. Let me test with `PYTHONPATH=src` for now (I'll reinstall properly later).

All modules import cleanly. Let me reinstall the package editable so the console script and `import competitive_intel` work without `PYTHONPATH`.

The build needs `README.md` (referenced in `pyproject.toml`). Let me create the skimmable root README now, then reinstall.

CLI is wired. Let me sanity-check the deterministic pipeline (rerank → ledger → verify → render) with synthetic data, no network.

Let me read the full console script to understand why it resolves but `python -c` doesn't.

The editable `.pth` isn't being processed in this uv-created venv (likely the spaced path). Let me confirm whether `addsitedir` resolves it, which tells me the cleanest fix.

Diagnosis: the package imports fine (manual `src` insert works); the uv-created venv just isn't processing the editable `.pth` (spaced path / uv quirk). I'll make this robust via pytest `pythonpath` and a `__main__.py`, and use `PYTHONPATH=src` for live checks. Updating pyproject and adding `__main__.py`.

Now the functional test of the deterministic pipeline with `PYTHONPATH=src`.

The deterministic pipeline works end-to-end (fusion, stable `[S#]`, citation normalization, unsupported-claim dropping, coverage, render). Marking CLI done and building the evaluation module.

`eval/harness.py` thin runner.

Now the two deterministic test suites and shared fixtures.

Let me verify the actual signatures in orchestrator and synthesize before finalizing tests.

Let me verify the model field names match my test constructors.

`Citation` has no `category` field. Let me fix the test helper.

Now run the test suite.

Two issues: the local `.env` has no model key (so `resolve_provider` raises), and I need to see the fusion failure. Let me make the fixture inject a keyed settings, then re-run.

The BM25 corpus was too small (N=2 → IDF collapses to 0). With 3+ docs IDF is positive, which is the realistic case. Let me fix the test to use a 3-doc corpus.

RRF with `k=60` makes a single-rank Tavily lead dominate, so "lifts despite lower Tavily score" isn't guaranteed. Let me assert the defensible properties: BM25 rewards the on-topic passage, and fusion ranks the well-scored on-topic passage first.

All 12 tests pass. Let me check lints on what I've written and verify the CLI runs via module.

Tests and CLI are solid. Let me quickly confirm the reference template's doc structure so my `docs/` layout matches it, then write the docs.

The template is a full-stack generator; I'll use a sensible doc-rich layout. Let me read the remaining modules so my docs cite real functions accurately.

I now have full module context. Let me write the technical statement, then the architecture, runbooks, explainer, build log, and the sample generator.

Now the architecture doc with the workflow diagram.

Now the docs index and runbooks.

Now the explainer: index with the dual-audience template, then the chapters.

Now the build log and the sample generator.

Let me verify the existing sample brief matches the renderer's format.

Docs are done. Let me run the full suite once more to confirm everything is green, and check lints, before the MCP stretch.

For the MCP stretch, the user required verifying the API via the docs MCP. Let me check what tools the docs MCP exposes.

I have the verified API (`MultiServerMCPClient` + async `get_tools()` / `tool.ainvoke`). Let me wire the stretch cleanly. First, extract a shared result-normalizer in `tavily_tools.py` so both retrievers reuse it.

Now the MCP-backed retriever with the verified `langchain-mcp-adapters` API.

Now let `run_brief` accept an injected retriever, and wire the `--via-mcp` flag.

Now add the optional `mcp` extra to `pyproject.toml`.

Let me add an offline test for the shared payload normalizer (covers both the LangChain and MCP retriever paths), then run everything.

13 tests pass and the MCP module imports. Let me update the explainer's MCP-status section to reflect it's now wired, verify CLI help, and run a final lint.

All wired, lints clean, 13 tests green, CLI shows `--via-mcp`. Marking the final task complete.

The build is complete. Every item in the plan is implemented, tested, and documented.

## What was finished this session

**CLI** (`cli.py`) — Click command group with `brief` (positional company + `--focus/--window/--provider/--out/--via-mcp` options) and `eval`. Rich run-summary panel (provider/model, sources, coverage %, retries, duration, tokens). `python -m competitive_intel` works.

**Evaluation** (`evaluation.py`, `eval/cases.yaml`, `eval/harness.py`) — deterministic metrics only (citation coverage, source validity, recency adherence), pass/fail table, no DeepEval.

**Tests** — 13 deterministic, hermetic tests (no network):
- `test_rag_agent.py`: planning, BM25+RRF fusion, ledger dedupe/`[S#]` ids, citation normalization, hallucination-drop, payload normalizers, and a stubbed end-to-end run.
- `test_evals_observability.py`: eval metrics + that the pipeline emits JSON-serializable `RetrievalSpanMeta`/`RunSummary` artifacts, plus graceful no-op tracing.

**Docs** — `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` (audience, requirements-mapping table, architecture, Evidence Fusion), `docs/architecture.md` (mermaid diagram + module map), three runbooks, a 6-chapter dual-audience `docs/explainer/`, `docs/BUILD_LOG.md` (decisions + course-corrections), skimmable root `README.md`, and `examples/generate_sample.py`.

**Stretch** — `--via-mcp` wired via `McpTavilyRetriever` using the verified `langchain-mcp-adapters` API (`MultiServerMCPClient.get_tools()` + async `ainvoke`), behind an optional `[mcp]` extra, with shared normalizers unit-tested offline.

## Notable findings worth your attention

- **The `uv` venv doesn't load the editable `.pth`** (path contains spaces: `Tavily Take home`). The package itself is fine — I made it robust via pytest `pythonpath = ["src"]` and a `__main__.py`, and documented `PYTHONPATH=src python -m competitive_intel ...` as the fallback. On a normal path, `uv sync` + the `competitive-intel` console script work as-is.
- **Two verification gates need live keys** (a real `.env` with `TAVILY_API_KEY` + a model key, and `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`): the live brief and the Logfire trace. Everything else is green offline. The `--via-mcp` live round-trip is likewise unverified at build time — flagged honestly in the explainer and build log.

To run a real brief once you add keys to `.env`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m competitive_intel brief "Perplexity" --focus funding,product --window month
```

How do I test this out now?

**Cursor**

You have a `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` already set and a Tavily key placeholder. You need to add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` and fill in the real Tavily key. Here's the fastest path:

## Step 1 — Fill in `.env`

Open `.env` and replace the placeholders:

```
TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-your-real-key-here"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
LOGFIRE_TOKEN="pylf_..."
```

You only need one model key (Claude or OpenAI). Remove the `NEBIUS_API_KEY` line — it's not used.

## Step 2 — Run a brief

Because of the uv/venv path quirk noted in the build log, use the module form:

```bash
cd "/Users/mohithmanohar/Documents/Interview/Tavily Take home/competitive-intel-agent"
PYTHONPATH=src ./.venv/bin/python -m competitive_intel brief "Perplexity" --focus funding,product --window month
```

That's the demo-ready command. It will:
1. Plan finance-specific queries per category
2. Search Tavily (advanced, last month, finance topic) and extract full text
3. Rerank with BM25 + RRF
4. Build the evidence ledger with `[S#]` ids
5. Call Claude/OpenAI with the ledger as the only context
6. Verify citations deterministically, drop unsupported findings
7. Print a markdown brief + a run-summary panel

## Step 3 — Run the offline test suite (no keys needed)

```bash
cd "/Users/mohithmanohar/Documents/Interview/Tavily Take home/competitive-intel-agent"
./.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

All 13 tests are hermetic — they stub Tavily and the model, so they pass with no API keys.

## Step 4 — Check the Logfire trace

After running a real brief, open [logfire.pydantic.dev](https://logfire.pydantic.dev) and find the `competitive-intel` project. You'll see one trace per brief with spans for plan → retrieve\_rerank → ledger → synthesize → verify, the Tavily HTTP calls nested inside, and structured attributes for fused scores, citation coverage, and token usage.

## Step 5 — Save output to a file

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src ./.venv/bin/python -m competitive_intel brief "Anthropic" \
  --focus funding,product,hiring --window month \
  --out out/anthropic.md
```

## Step 6 — Run the eval (live, uses your keys)

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src ./.venv/bin/python -m competitive_intel eval --cases eval/cases.yaml
```

This runs briefs for all three cases in `eval/cases.yaml` and prints a table of citation coverage, source validity, recency adherence, and pass/fail per company.

Here's what was added. The README now has:

- A fallback note for the module-form invocation (`PYTHONPATH=src python -m competitive_intel ...`) for when the console script isn't on PATH
- A full **CLI reference** section for `brief` — every option with its allowed values, default, and description, plus four example commands covering common diligence patterns (pre-deal, broad profile, file output + provider override, MCP stretch)
- A full reference for `eval` — options table, example commands, and a plain-English explanation of the three deterministic metrics so a non-technical reader understands why there's no LLM judge

Move @competitive-intel-agent/TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md to docs and change references accordingly.

Also for the runbooks, change the name for @competitive-intel-agent/docs/runbooks/03-run-evaluations.md to just run-evluations
And club the @competitive-intel-agent/docs/runbooks/01-generate-a-brief.md and @competitive-intel-agent/docs/runbooks/02-read-the-trace.md together. Don't change any content, only club

---

**Cursor**

Let me read all the relevant files first.

Now I have everything I need. I'll do all the changes in parallel: create the merged runbook, rename the eval runbook, move the technical statement, update the docs index and README, and delete the old files.

Now update all references, then delete the old files.

Update the reference inside `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` (now at `docs/`) and the back-reference in the explainer.

Now check if `docs/TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` has any self-referential paths that need adjusting (it was one level up before).

The links inside `docs/TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` use `docs/explainer/...` paths which were relative to the repo root — now they need to be `explainer/...` since the file lives in `docs/`. Also fix the repo map and self-description.

Now delete the old files.

Let me do a final check that no stale links remain pointing at the old paths.

The `docs/README.md` link is fine — it already points to `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` which resolves correctly relative to `docs/`. The root `README.md` correctly points to `docs/TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md`. All clean.

Here's a summary of what changed:

**Moved**
- `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` → `docs/TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` (relative links inside it updated: `docs/explainer/` → `explainer/`)

**Renamed**
- `docs/runbooks/03-run-evaluations.md` → `docs/runbooks/run-evaluations.md`

**Clubbed**
- `docs/runbooks/01-generate-a-brief.md` + `docs/runbooks/02-read-the-trace.md` → `docs/runbooks/generate-a-brief-and-trace.md` (content unchanged, separated by `---`)

**References updated**
- `README.md` → `docs/TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md`
- `docs/README.md` → new runbook names
- `docs/explainer/04-observability.md` → `generate-a-brief-and-trace.md`

---

**User**

Rename @competitive-intel-agent/docs/runbooks/generate-a-brief-and-trace.md to run-generate-intel or similar

---

**Cursor**

Done. The file is now `docs/runbooks/run-generate-intel.md` and both references (the docs index and the observability explainer) are updated.

---

**User**

Alright now let's club all explainer files @competitive-intel-agent/docs/explainer/01-the-problem.md @competitive-intel-agent/docs/explainer/02-evidence-fusion.md @competitive-intel-agent/docs/explainer/03-grounded-synthesis-and-verification.md @competitive-intel-agent/docs/explainer/04-observability.md @competitive-intel-agent/docs/explainer/05-context-isolation.md @2606_Tavily_FDE_TakeHome/2606_Tavily_FDE_TakeHomeAssignment.md  into @competitive-intel-agent/docs/explainer/Explainer - Summary.md , remember  I already have the problem content copied in, so change references to these docs in places accordingly too

Also, for the @competitive-intel-agent/docs/explainer/Explainer - cursor_take_home_assignment_planning.md add a reference to it, it;s the coding agent summary. Maybe rename it to Explainer - Coding Agent Summary (Cursor)

---

**Cursor**

Let me read all the files first.

Now I have everything. Let me write the combined summary, rename the planning file, and update all references.

Now rename the planning file and update the explainer README.

Now delete the individual chapter files and do a final stale-reference check.

Three stale links to fix.

Clean. Here's what was done:

**`Explainer - Summary.md`** — rewritten to club all five chapters together, with the original assignment brief added at the top as context. Chapter 02's cross-reference to ch03 now uses an in-page anchor. The bottom includes a link to the Coding Agent Summary.

**Renamed** `Explainer - cursor_take_home_assignment_planning.md` → `Explainer - Coding Agent Summary (Cursor).md`

**`docs/explainer/README.md`** — updated to point to the single summary file for chapters 01–05 (with anchor links), kept `06-tavily-mcp.md` as a separate entry, and added the Coding Agent Summary as its own row.

**Deleted** the five individual chapter files (01–05).

**Fixed stale links** in `docs/BUILD_LOG.md`, `docs/TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md`, and `docs/explainer/06-tavily-mcp.md` — all now point to the correct anchors inside the summary.

---

**User**

Oh wait you forgot to move @competitive-intel-agent/docs/explainer/06-tavily-mcp.md as well to @competitive-intel-agent/docs/explainer/Explainer - Summary.md 

---

**Cursor**

Now update the README and fix the stale link in `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` that pointed to `06-tavily-mcp.md`, then delete the file.

One remaining — that was the old ch05 Tavily value section cross-referencing ch06. Since they're now in the same doc, it becomes an anchor link.

All clean. Chapter 06 is now folded into `Explainer - Summary.md` (all 6 chapters in one file), the README chapter index updated to point to the in-page anchor, the `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` link updated, and `06-tavily-mcp.md` deleted.

---

**User**

move @competitive-intel-agent/docs/BUILD_LOG.md to explainer and updated references, also change its name to Explainer - Build Log

---

**Cursor**

The files are identical — the `Explainer - Build Log.md` in explainer already exists and matches. So I just need to delete `docs/BUILD_LOG.md` and update the references pointing to it.

Four references to update, then delete the old file.

Also fix the internal link inside the Build Log itself (it references `explainer/Explainer - Summary.md` with a path that was relative to `docs/`, now it's in `docs/explainer/` so the path needs shortening).

Those remaining mentions are all inside the Coding Agent Summary — that's a historical session log recording what was planned/built, so the old path names there are accurate record-keeping rather than broken links. No action needed on those.

Done. Summary of changes:

- `docs/BUILD_LOG.md` deleted (the identical copy already existed at `docs/explainer/Explainer - Build Log.md`)
- Internal link in `Explainer - Build Log.md` fixed (path shortened since the file is now already in `docs/explainer/`)
- **4 references updated** to point to the new location:
  - `README.md` → `docs/explainer/Explainer - Build Log.md`
  - `docs/README.md` → same
  - `docs/TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` → repo map updated (removed `BUILD_LOG.md` from the listing)
  - `docs/explainer/Explainer - Summary.md` → link in the MCP chapter updated

I think Architecture should be in explainer -summary, move it to the start of that doc right after page template

---

**Cursor**

Now update the references to `architecture.md` that pointed to it as a separate file, and fix the `docs/README.md` and `docs/explainer/README.md` entries.

Now delete the standalone `architecture.md`.

Done. The Architecture section (full mermaid diagram, module boundary table, typed artifacts, and configuration knobs) now sits right after the page template in `Explainer - Summary.md`, making it the first thing an engineer sees before diving into the chapters. All four live references updated; the Coding Agent Summary's historical mentions are left as-is since they're a build record.

---

**User**

Remove @competitive-intel-agent/docs/explainer/README.md and it's references

**Cursor**

Done. Both references in `docs/README.md` now point directly to `Explainer - Summary.md`, and the file is deleted. The Coding Agent Summary mention is a historical planning note so left as-is.

Which re-ranking model is being used here?

---

**Cursor**

There's no neural re-ranking model — it's a two-signal **rank fusion** approach, not a learned model:

**Signal 1 — Tavily relevance score** (`r.score`): the semantic relevance score Tavily returns with each result (0–1, computed on Tavily's side).

**Signal 2 — BM25Okapi** (`rank_bm25` library): a classical lexical scoring function. It tokenises each passage and the query, then scores passages by term frequency weighted by inverse document frequency. No embeddings, no network call — pure bag-of-words math over the retrieved texts.

**Fusion — Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**: rather than blending the raw scores (which live on incompatible scales), it converts each into a *rank*, then combines them:

```
fused_score = 1 / (k + tavily_rank) + 1 / (k + bm25_rank)
```

`k=60` (default) dampens the influence of top-ranked documents, making the fusion robust to outliers. The passages are then sorted by `fused_score` descending and the top-K kept.

**Why no neural cross-encoder?** A cross-encoder (e.g. a `sentence-transformers` reranker) would add latency, an extra model dependency, and cost for what is already a small candidate set (5 results per category query). BM25 + RRF gets the key benefit — lexical signal rewards passages that literally contain the query terms (company name, "Series B", dollar amounts) while Tavily handles semantic relevance — without any of that overhead.

**User**

I think within the agent folder, I feel we can further make more sub-folders like evals and observability and models. And maybe synthesize & verify could be a part of the pipeline directory?

And the root agent directory should just be the cli and config. Let's re-structure and don't change any code in this process.

Change references in readme and dependencies wherever necessary

**Cursor**

Let me read all the files that will be affected before touching anything.

Now I have the complete picture. Let me plan this carefully before touching anything.

I have everything I need. Let me build the `TodoWrite` plan and execute it all in one sweep.

`models.py` has no relative imports, so it copies verbatim. `observability`, `evals`, and the three pipeline files each need one small import fix.

Now fix the relative imports in each new file:

Now update all the files that import from the moved modules:

System Python is 3.9 - need to use the project's venv:

All 13 tests pass. Now update the docs.

Let me search for all path references in docs that need updating:

Let me also check `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` and `README.md` for the repo map:

Let me read the relevant sections to make precise edits:

Now fix the runbook:

Now update `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` — repo map and inline prose references:

Now update the repo map and inline prose references:

Now fix the remaining inline prose mentions (outside the table/map):

Now update `README.md` — it has a directory tree and brief module list:

README only uses generic prose, no file paths — no change needed there. Let me do a final check to make sure there are no leftover stale references anywhere:

Those `competitive_intel.models` imports are correct — `models/` is now a package and they resolve fine. Let me do one final scan to confirm zero stale `.py` file references remain in docs:

Clean. Let me run the tests one final time to confirm the complete picture:

13/13 passing.

All done. Here's what changed:

**New directory structure** (`src/competitive_intel/`):

```
src/competitive_intel/

**User**

So __init__ is supposed to be empty in models, observability and evals folders. Move them to files in their respective folders with their functionalities accordignly. For example, evals init will be in evaluations.py and so on

---

**Cursor**

Let me read all three current `__init__.py` files to know exactly what to re-export.

Got it. The logic stays in named files (`models.py`, `observability.py`, `evaluation.py`), and `__init__.py` becomes a thin re-export surface so all existing imports keep working.

Now replace each `__init__.py` with a minimal re-export shim:

Verify tests still pass:

13/13 still passing. The final layout for each package:

**`models/`**
```
models/
├── __init__.py   ← re-exports only (CATEGORIES, Brief, Category, …)
└── models.py     ← all Pydantic v2 model definitions
```

**`observability/`**
```
observability/
├── __init__.py   ← re-exports only (configure, span, log_model)
└── observability.py  ← Logfire setup, span(), log_model()
```

**`evals/`**
```
evals/
├── __init__.py   ← re-exports only (compute_metrics, run_eval, format_report, …)
└── evaluation.py ← all deterministic metric logic
```

Each `__init__.py` is now a thin, declarative surface (`from .module import …; __all__ = […]`) with no logic in it. All existing imports — `from competitive_intel.models import Brief`, `from competitive_intel.evals import run_eval`, etc. — continue to work without any callers needing changes.

Let's do a python ruff check for the files and also move all package imports to the beginnind of the file in all cases

---

**Cursor**

4 issues to fix, plus I need to identify all lazy in-function imports across the codebase and hoist them. Let me read the affected files in one go.

Now let me find every other lazy in-function import across the whole codebase:

Good picture. Let me also read the remaining files I need to edit:

Now I have the full picture. Here's the strategy:
- **Hoist to module level**: all imports inside regular functions
- **Keep inside function**: `logfire`, `openinference`, and `McpTavilyRetriever` (optional/conditional deps that may not be installed)
- **Ruff fixes**: remove unused `Brief` lazy import → add to top-level, remove unused `Category` from `rerank.py`, remove unused `date` from test

Let me do all edits in parallel:

**`orchestrator.py`** — add `Brief` to top-level import, remove lazy import inside function, fix return type annotation:

**`rerank.py`** — remove unused `Category` import:

**`evals/evaluation.py`** — hoist all three lazy imports to the top:

**`cli.py`** — hoist `render_markdown`, `run_brief`, `format_report`/`run_eval` to top; remove lazy imports inside functions:

**`__init__.py`** — hoist the import, drop the wrapper function, export `run_brief` directly:

**`tests/conftest.py`** — hoist all three imports to module level:

**`tests/test_rag_agent.py`** — remove unused `date`, hoist `tavily_tools` and `run_brief` imports:

**`tests/test_evals_observability.py`** — hoist `run_brief` and `observability`:

Now run ruff check and the test suite together:

Ruff: all checks passed. Tests: 13/13. Here's a summary of every change made:

**Ruff fixes (4 errors → 0):**
- `orchestrator.py` — added `Brief` to the top-level import block, removed the lazy `from ..models import Brief` inside `run_brief()`, fixed return type from `tuple["Brief", ...]` to `tuple[Brief, ...]`
- `rerank.py` — removed the unused `Category` from the models import
- `test_rag_agent.py` — removed the unused `from datetime import date`

**Imports hoisted to module top:**

| File | Imports moved |
|---|---|
| `evals/evaluation.py` | `run_brief`, `render_markdown`, `Table` (rich) |
| `cli.py` | `run_brief`, `render_markdown`, `format_report`, `run_eval` |
| `__init__.py` | `run_brief` from `pipeline.orchestrator` (wrapper function removed) |
| `tests/conftest.py` | `orchestrator`, `SynthesisResult`, `get_settings` |
| `tests/test_rag_agent.py` | `run_brief`, `extracted_from_payload`, `results_from_payload` |
| `tests/test_evals_observability.py` | `run_brief`, `observability` |

**Kept inside function (legitimately conditional):**
- `observability/observability.py` — `import logfire` and `from openinference...` inside `try/except` blocks (optional deps that may not be installed)
- `cli.py` — `from .tools.tavily_mcp import McpTavilyRetriever` inside `if via_mcp: try/except` (optional MCP extra)

---

**User**

            from .tools.tavily_mcp import McpTavilyRetriever


I still see some package imports present in many places in the repo instead of the top of files. Change it

---

**Cursor**

Let me find every remaining in-function import across the whole codebase first.

Three files. Let me read all of them in full before touching anything.

Three files, three different patterns. Let me apply the right treatment to each:

- **`cli.py`**: `McpTavilyRetriever` is importable even without the `mcp` extra (the guard is inside `__init__`), so just hoist it
- **`observability.py`**: `logfire` and `LangChainInstrumentor` may genuinely not be installed — hoist with module-level `try/except` so the function body stays clean
- **`tavily_mcp.py`**: same pattern for `MultiServerMCPClient`

Now `observability.py` — hoist both optional imports to module level with `try/except`, then clean up the function body:

Now `tavily_mcp.py` — hoist `MultiServerMCPClient` to module level:

Now run ruff and tests to confirm everything is clean:

Ruff: all checks passed. Tests: 13/13. Zero in-function imports remain anywhere in the repo.

Here's what was done to each of the three files:

**`cli.py`** — straightforward hoist; `McpTavilyRetriever` is always importable (its guard is inside `__init__`), so it moved cleanly to the top-level imports and the `try/except` now only wraps the instantiation call.

**`observability/observability.py`** — both `logfire` and `LangChainInstrumentor` are genuinely optional. They're now imported at module level inside `try/except` blocks that assign `None` on failure. The `configure()` function is simplified to `if _logfire_module is None: return False` and `if LangChainInstrumentor is not None: ...` — same runtime behaviour, no in-function imports.

**`tools/tavily_mcp.py`** — `MultiServerMCPClient` is hoisted to module level with a `try/except ImportError` that assigns `None`. The `__init__` now checks `if MultiServerMCPClient is None: raise RuntimeError(...)` instead of catching an import error mid-method.

There's an issue in the TECHNICAL_STATEMENT

The link is wrapped in a backtick, making it render as inline code instead of a clickable link.

Removed the surrounding backticks — the link was being rendered as a code literal instead of a clickable markdown link.

It says not available file

**Cursor**

Let me check whether the `#architecture` anchor actually exists in the target file.

The anchor exists. The issue is likely the path — let me verify the exact link and how other working links are formatted in the same file.

The `%20` encoding is the problem — Cursor's markdown renderer looks for the literal filename rather than URL-decoding the path. The fix is to wrap paths that contain spaces in angle brackets, which is the standard CommonMark way to handle spaces in links.

Now let me check if the same `%20` encoding issue exists anywhere else in the docs:

Quite a few. Let me fix them all at once:

Now I have everything. Fixing all `%20`-encoded links across all four files:

Now do a final sweep to make sure nothing was missed:

Zero `%20` remaining anywhere. Every link with spaces is now written using the `[label](<path with spaces>)` angle-bracket format, which all CommonMark renderers (Cursor, VS Code, GitHub) resolve correctly to the actual filename.

What happened to the original architecture diagram that was like a workflow with boxes based on current implementation, let's bring that back and name the section in technical_statement as Workflow

---

**Cursor**

Let me check both files for what's currently there and what was there before.

The full Mermaid diagram lives in the Explainer. Let me read it precisely.

Got it. Now I'll replace the ASCII sketch in `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` with the full Mermaid diagram, and rename the section from **Architecture** to **Workflow**.

Done. Section `## 5. Architecture` is now `## 5. Workflow` and the plain ASCII sketch is replaced with the full Mermaid `flowchart TD` diagram — identical to the one in the Explainer — showing:

- **CLI entry point** → plan → retrieve → rerank → validate (self-correction loop) → ledger
- ledger → **synthesize** → **verify** → render + RunSummary
- Dashed observability subgraph wired to retrieve, synthesize, and verify

Module paths are updated to reflect the current structure (`pipeline/synthesize.py`, `pipeline/verify.py`, `pipeline/render.py`, `observability/`).

**User**

We're talking about the @competitive-intel-agent/docs/TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md 

1) I think the workflow diagram is flawed. Relook at the current implementation and carefully build out the mermaid diagram accordingly (Only for this, change what's also there in the explainer -summary.md)

2) Why a pipeline instead of create_agent

create_agent + ToolStrategy shines when the model must decide when to call tools and also return structured output in one loop. Here retrieval is deterministic and synthesis is a single grounded call — so a plain chain is more precise, cheaper, and far easier to test and observe. (An optional create_agent-style "research mode" is noted as future work in the explainer.)We'

I don't know if I agree with this, since we do have a non-deterministic call using the Tavily API for extract. The value prop I guess here is faster retrieval versus a whole thinking process I guess.

3) None of the links within the TECHNICAL_STATEMENT is working at all - for access to other documents within the docs

4) Let's write a reasoning decision on why Logfire is a better fit versus Langsmith in the Observability section of TECHNICAL_STATEMENT

5) Let's modify the retrieval concept to make it more digestible

6) Like how the Explainer - Summary has all of the business perspective baked into each section, here in the TECHNICAL_STATEMENT you can add the same business perspective, probably in either each section or at the start of the doc. Whicchever is cleaner.

Can we rename the explainer files to explainer-summary and so on along with changing references just so that the naming convention is consistent


---

**Cursor**

This is a substantial multi-part task. Let me set up a todo list and start by carefully reading the actual implementation so I can build an accurate diagram.

Let me read the full pipeline implementation and the current docs.

Now the rest of the pipeline: rerank, ledger, synthesize, verify, and config.

Now I have a full understanding of the implementation. Let me read the complete `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` and the relevant Explainer sections.

Let me get the structure of the Explainer files (headings/anchors) and find all references to them across the repo.

Let me get exact reference lines and read the Explainer files' diagram section more fully.

I now have a complete and accurate picture of the implementation. Key correction for the diagram: retrieve→rerank→validate runs as a **per-category loop**, the two Tavily calls (search + extract) are distinct, and the ledger is built **once** after the loop aggregating all categories — the current diagram flattens all of this.

Let me start executing. First, the file renames (which also fixes the broken-links problem, since clean names have no spaces).

Now update references in the non-TECHNICAL_STATEMENT files (README.md, docs/README.md, and the two explainer files). I'll handle TECHNICAL_STATEMENT comprehensively in its own rewrite.

Now update the diagram in `explainer-summary.md` to match the true implementation.

Let me verify no stale references to the old names remain anywhere.

Only TECHNICAL_STATEMENT references remain — I'll fix those as part of its rewrite. Let me check the renamed coding-agent-summary for any self/internal references and the runbooks.

Now the main work in `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md`. First, the Workflow section — corrected diagram, rewritten `create_agent` reasoning, fixed link, and a business line.

Now the retrieval concept section (Section 6) — make it more digestible and fix its link, plus a business line.

Now the Grounding (Section 7) business line and the Observability (Section 8) rewrite with the Logfire-vs-LangSmith decision.

Now the remaining sections — Evaluation business line, and the MCP section's broken link (Section 12). Let me read the current tail of the doc.

Now fix the last broken link in the MCP section (Section 12).

Let me verify no broken links or stale references remain anywhere in the docs.

No stale references, no `%20`, and no link targets containing spaces. Let me do a final read-through of the updated TECHNICAL_STATEMENT to confirm it's coherent.

The whole document reads coherently. Let me mark the remaining todos complete.

All eight items are done. Here's a summary of everything that changed.

**1. Workflow diagram (fixed in both `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` §5 and `explainer-summary.md`)**
The old diagram flattened retrieval into a single linear pass with the ledger sitting inside the retrieve subgraph. The corrected diagram now reflects the actual code:
- `build_plan` produces one query per category
- a **per-category loop** (`_retrieve_and_rank_category`) does: TavilySearch → TavilyExtract (two distinct Tavily calls) → `fuse_category` (BM25⊕RRF) → validate, with a broaden-and-retry edge looping back
- `build_ledger` runs **once after the loop**, deduping across all categories
- then the single synthesis call → verify → render + RunSummary
- I added a one-line note under the diagram calling out the loop + single-ledger structure.

**2. "Why a pipeline instead of `create_agent`"** — rewritten honestly. It now opens by conceding the pipeline is *not* fully deterministic (live Tavily calls + one LLM call), and reframes the real distinction as **fixed control flow vs. model-decided control flow**. The value prop is now speed / predictable cost / reproducible-and-testable path, with adaptivity called out as the explicit trade-off (the future "research mode").

**3. Broken links** — root cause was spaces in the `Explainer - *.md` filenames. Renaming to kebab-case (see #8) plus rewriting every link to the clean path (no spaces, no `%20`, no angle-bracket workarounds) fixed all three links in TECHNICAL_STATEMENT and the references in `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, and the explainer files. Verified zero stale references remain.

**4. Logfire vs LangSmith** — added a "Why Logfire over LangSmith" subsection to §8 with a comparison table, arguing from the fact that this system is *mostly not LLM* → an OpenTelemetry-first tool captures HTTP + custom deterministic stages + the LLM call as one trace, avoids vendor lock-in, logs Pydantic artifacts natively, and degrades to a no-op. Notes the single-backend decision.

**5. Retrieval concept (§6)** — made more digestible: a one-line problem statement, the four layers (Live / Lexical / Fusion / Ledger) as a scannable table with a "why it matters" column, and the two control steps (self-correction, synthesis) pulled out separately.

**6. Business perspective** — added concise `> **Business value:**` callouts to the technical sections (Workflow, Retrieval, Grounding, Observability, Evaluation), mirroring the Explainer's dual-audience template. Sections 1–4 were already business-framed, so the doc now carries that lens throughout. Also fixed some malformed bold markup in the Evaluation metric list.

**8. Renames**
- `Explainer - Summary.md` → `explainer-summary.md`
- `Explainer - Build Log.md` → `explainer-build-log.md`
- `Explainer - Coding Agent Summary (Cursor).md` → `explainer-coding-agent-summary.md`

All cross-references across the repo updated to match.

Let's change the technical statement also into lower case and change references.

Maker the workflow a bit more concise in each of the boxes

**Cursor**

Let me find all references first, then read the current diagram.

Three things to do in parallel: rename the file, tighten the diagram, then update all navigational references.

Now tighten the diagram and fix the self-reference inside the file:

Fix the self-reference inside the file:

Now update the two navigational references in `README.md` and `docs/README.md`:

Final check — no stale `TECHNICAL_STATEMENT` references remain in navigational files:

Those remaining hits are all inside `explainer-coding-agent-summary.md` — that's the build log / conversation record, so the old name there is correct historical context. All navigational links (README, docs/README, self-reference in the document itself) are updated.

**Summary of changes:**

- `docs/TECHNICAL_STATEMENT.md` → `docs/technical-statement.md`
- Updated links in `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, and the self-reference inside the file
- Workflow diagram boxes tightened — each node is now 2–3 short lines maximum:
  - `CLI: brief <company> --focus --window`
  - `plan.py → PlanItem[] (1 query / category)`
  - Per-category loop subgraph: `retrieve.py / TavilySearch + TavilyExtract`, `rerank.py / BM25 ⊕ Tavily via RRF`, threshold diamond
  - `ledger.py / dedupe · stable [S1..Sn] → EvidenceLedger`
  - `synthesize.py / 1 LLM call · ledger only → DraftBrief [S#]`
  - `verify.py (no LLM) / resolve citations · drop unsupported → Brief + coverage%`
  - `render.py → markdown` and `RunSummary`
  - Observability subgraph: `span() per stage / httpx · requests · log_model()`

Maker the workflow a bit more concise in each of the boxes in both locations

the worflow in @competitive-intel-agent/docs/explainer/explainer-summary.md  is right , make it same for both but reduce words within boxes

---

**Cursor**

The structure is identical in both; the concise version I already put in `technical-statement.md` is the target. Let me apply that same concise diagram to `explainer-summary.md` so both match exactly.

Both diagrams are now identical and concise. The boxes are trimmed to the essentials — module name plus a short input→output line — while keeping the correct structure (per-category retrieve→rerank→validate loop, ledger built once after, single LLM synthesis, no-LLM verify, and the observability subgraph). The verbose function names, parenthetical detail, and full instrumentation list have been dropped from the nodes since the surrounding prose already covers them.

Also add a request response diagram

---

**Cursor**

A request–response (sequence) diagram is a good complement to the flowchart. Let me check the exact insertion points in both files.

Now I'll add the sequence diagram to both. In `technical-statement.md` (between the key-structure paragraph and the `create_agent` subsection):

Now the same in `explainer-summary.md`, right after the flowchart and before the "Why these boundaries" section:

Added an identical request–response sequence diagram to both `docs/technical-statement.md` (§5 Workflow, under a new "Request–response sequence" subsection) and `docs/explainer/explainer-summary.md` (new "Request–response sequence" section after the flowchart).

It complements the flowchart by showing the run as messages between actors:
- **User → CLI → `run_brief`**, with Logfire span opened up front
- **Per-category loop**: `search` → `SearchResult[]`, `extract` → full text, in-process rerank note, and an optional broadened re-`search` (≤1 retry)
- **`build_ledger`** note, then the single **`synthesize`** call to the LLM returning a `DraftBrief`, **`verify`** (no LLM) note
- `log_model` to Logfire, and the **`Brief` + `RunSummary`** response flowing back out to the user as the markdown brief

This makes the request/response boundaries with the external services (Tavily, the model provider, Logfire) explicit, where the flowchart emphasizes the data transformations.

You see how it is rendered. I don't understand

The problem is the backward retry edge (`V → R`) — Mermaid's TD layout engine places `retrieve.py` *below* the decision diamond to satisfy that edge, flipping the visual order. The fix is to eliminate the backward edge by representing the retry as a **forward branch** that converges at the ledger. Both paths then flow down cleanly.

The same broken diagram is in both files. I'll replace it with a forward-only version — the retry becomes a parallel branch that merges back at the ledger, so no backward edges exist at all.

The root cause: Mermaid's dagre layout engine is a **directed acyclic graph** renderer. When you give it a backward edge (`V → R`, pointing up), it resolves the cycle by placing `R` *below* `V` in the layout — making retrieval appear after the decision diamond, which is the opposite of what you want.

The fix: the retry is now represented as a **forward branch** — `V -- "yes · broaden query" → RT` (a new node for the re-fetch) — and both the happy path (`V -- no`) and the retry path (`RT`) independently converge at `L` (the ledger). All edges flow strictly downward, so dagre lays them out correctly. The subgraph "Runs once per focus category" now contains only forward edges internally and renders in the right order: retrieve → rerank → validate → (two clean exits).

?What's this L and P. Also let's remove the request - response put it back how it was

---

**Cursor**

The `P` and `L` are showing as raw node IDs because Mermaid creates a node the first time it sees the ID — if it appears in an edge before its label definition, the label never sticks. The fix: use descriptive multi-word IDs so they're self-documenting, and define labels before they appear in edges. I'll also strip the sequence diagram from both files.

Now I have the full picture. Replacing both in one pass:

Same fix in the explainer:

Done. Two root causes fixed:

**Why P and L showed as bare letters:** Mermaid locks in a node's label the first time it sees the ID. In the old diagram, `V -- no --> L` and `RT --> L` appeared *before* `L["ledger.py..."]` was defined — so Mermaid created node `L` with the label `"L"` and ignored the later definition. Same issue with `P`: connecting `P["plan.py..."] --> LOOP` where `LOOP` is a subgraph ID confused the renderer. The fix is to **declare all node labels at the top**, then list edges separately, which is what the new version does.

**Changes made to both `technical-statement.md` and `explainer-summary.md`:**
- Dropped the subgraph wrapper around the per-category loop (it was mangling layout and causing the edge-before-definition bug)
- Replaced single-letter IDs (`P`, `L`, `R`, `RR`, `V`, `RT`, `S`, `VF`) with descriptive IDs (`PLAN`, `LEDGER`, `RETRIEVE`, `RERANK`, `THRESH`, `RETRY`, `SYNTH`, `VERIFY`) so the diagram is self-explanatory even if labels glitch
- All node labels are now defined before any edges reference them
- Removed the request–response sequence diagram entirely, reverting to just the flowchart

There was a diagram without the request resonse bring that back

---

**Cursor**

Let me check the current state of the file to confirm what's there now.

The file is already in the correct state — the flowchart is there and the sequence diagram has been removed. This is exactly "the diagram without the request-response." The sequence diagram was stripped in my previous edit; only the flowchart remains now.

If you refresh the preview in your editor you should see just the single flowchart. The key changes from the broken version:
- All node labels are declared at the top before any edges reference them (fixes the bare `P` and `L` letters)
- Descriptive node IDs (`PLAN`, `LEDGER`, `RETRIEVE`, etc.) instead of single letters
- No sequence diagram — just the flowchart, same as before it was added

Why a fixed pipeline instead of create_agent

To be precise: this pipeline is not fully deterministic. It makes live Tavily search/extract calls (the web changes minute to minute) and one LLM synthesis call. What is deterministic is the control flow — which stages run, in what order, how many Tavily calls happen, and when we stop. That is the real distinction from create_agent + ToolStrategy, where the model decides which tool to call, with what arguments, and how many times.

Fixing the control flow in code rather than delegating it to the model buys:





Speed — no multi-turn "think → pick a tool → observe → think again" loop. We issue a known set of Tavily calls and exactly one synthesis call, so latency is bounded and predictable instead of scaling with however many reasoning turns the model decides to take.



Predictable cost — token spend doesn't balloon with agent deliberation; it's one bounded synthesis call over a token-capped ledger.



Testability & observability — the path is reproducible, so every stage is unit-testable and each maps to exactly one span in the trace. We can assert on the control flow even though the web data underneath it varies.

The trade-off is adaptivity: a fixed flow can't decide on its own to dig deeper when a finding looks surprising. That agentic "research mode" (a create_agent-style deep-dive loop) is deliberately scoped out as future work — the diligence use case rewards a fast, repeatable, auditable brief over an open-ended investigation.
Make this more concise,

Trimmed from 10 lines to 4. Same three points (speed, cost, testability) and the trade-off acknowledgement, without the sub-bullets and business value callout.
